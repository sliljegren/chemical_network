Access to the chemical network used in [Liljegren+2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/10/aa38116-20/aa38116-20.html) and [Liljegren+2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07021), describing the chemistry and molecular formation in supernovae. For more information about details see the paper. 


## Interactive dashbord

Through the jupyter notebook `chem_network_wb.ipynb` you can:

1. Inspect all the reactions in a specified work.
2. Find specific reaction(s) by specifying the reactants and/or the products.
3. Plot one or more rate, for comparision.

Instructions are available in notebook.
